## 📋 What is Handora?

Handora is a tool that uses your computer’s camera to track your hand gestures, face, and body in real time. It uses AI technology to understand your movements and lets you interact with games and apps by waving your hand or moving your body. All of this happens right in your web browser without needing extra hardware or software.

You can play gesture-controlled games, interact with animations, and see your movements reflected on screen instantly. Handora combines computer vision with easy-to-use controls to make interacting with your computer more natural and fun.

## 🎮 Using Handora

After opening Handora, you will see a live video from your webcam on screen.

- **Hand Tracking:** Move your hand in front of the camera. Colored highlights will show which parts of your hand the system sees.
- **Face Detection:** Your face will be outlined or receive special effects to show detection.
- **Body Tracking:** Stand in clear view of the camera to see your full body pose detected.
- **Game Controls:** Use hand waves, pointing, or other gestures to interact with games shown on screen.
- **Laser Pointer:** Extend a finger and move it to control a cursor or laser pointer for interacting with elements on screen.

Try moving your hands slowly at first. The app works best when your hand is well-lit and close to the center of the camera view. Avoid very fast movements.

## 🛠 Troubleshooting Tips

If Handora does not work as expected, try the following:

- **Webcam Not Detected:** Make sure your webcam is connected and not used by another program.
- **No Video Feed:** Refresh your browser or restart the app. Check browser permissions to allow webcam use.
- **Tracking is Slow:** Close other heavy apps or browser tabs. Try again in a well-lit room.
- **Hand or Face Not Recognized:** Position yourself and your hands closer to the camera and ensure they are fully visible.
- **Game Controls Not Responding:** Make sure gestures are clear and deliberate. Check if the app is focused and receiving inputs.

## 🔐 Privacy and Security

Handora uses your webcam to track gestures and movements locally on your machine. No video data is sent to external servers. Webcam access is used only during use and must be granted by you.

You can stop using the app at any time by closing the browser tab or application.
